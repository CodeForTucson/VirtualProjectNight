# Virtual Project Night
Welcome for newcomers on our biweekly project nights

## About Us
We harness technology, data, and design to tackle local issues and make Tucson a better place to live.
We're a local brigade of the national Code for America that puts technology to work in service of our communities. You don't need to be a coder to participate. Volunteers from all walks of life are invited to join us!

## How to find a project
- Join our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Tucson/) and [Slack](https://codefortucson.slack.com/)
- Take a look at our [Code for Tucson Website](https://www.codefortucson.com/)
- Explore our [existing projects](https://github.com/orgs/CodeForTucson/projects) or start your own!
- Once you find one you're interested in, feel free to pick up an issue, or create something you think would be helpful! For beginners, try to look for issues tagged with ["good first issue"](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+user%3ACodeForTucson)
 
 ## How to contribute code
 If you're a beginner, join our biweekly meetings. A good first contribute would be to log our meeting notes in this repo. We'll help you out with this, but if you'd like to try it yourself, see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
